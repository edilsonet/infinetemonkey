# Retrieval Load Order Policy

Operative policy for what an agent loads, in what order, when retrieving from a namespace.
This file is the executable rule layer. The reasoning, including why retrieval is the
operating layer and why the right small fragments beat a large context, lives in
[[retrieval-over-raw-memory]].

Scope: contract Part 11 (name the consumer, retrieval over raw memory) and Part 4 of the
guardrails (G7, name the retrieval consumer). This policy is what the namespace `INDEX.md`
load surface and `canon/agent-load-order.md` implement.

## Name the consumer (G7, locked)

Rule LOAD-1: surfaces are designed for the reader that actually retrieves today. The
consumer is named, not assumed.

- Today: Claude Code and Codex file-reading agents. They retrieve by `Glob`, `Grep`, and
  `Read` over the working tree. The retrieval surface is the filesystem: folder names,
  frontmatter, `INDEX.md`, and `[[wikilinks]]`.
- Since 2026-09-30: a semantic retriever also sits in front of the same tree. `tools/anac-rag`
  is a Cloudflare Worker over a Vectorize index of heading-aware windows built from
  `knowledge/anac-legislacao/support/extracted/`. It is an adapter at the edge. It is **not**
  the retrieval surface, it does not change the entity model, and the filesystem stays
  authoritative. Every vector carries the fragment identifier of the citation block it was
  cut from, so a semantic hit resolves to the same fragment the keyword index would name.
- The reader is therefore hybrid, and the load order below is two-stage. **Precision first:**
  canon, then `support/indexes/keyword-index.yml`, then only the named fragments.
  **Recall second:** `POST /query` on `tools/anac-rag` when the keyword index has no key for
  the phrasing. Precision resolves the question; recall rescues a phrasing the index missed.
  Neither replaces the other.

Because the reader today greps and reads files, the load order is expressed as a sequence
of files to read, not as a query to an index. Every rule below assumes a file-reading
agent.

## Canon-first load order (locked)

Rule LOAD-2: the standard load order for a serious namespace is:

1. The namespace `INDEX.md`. It is the router and operating brief: profile, load-first
   list, query classes, stable-vs-stateful split, open disputes, what the namespace
   drives, common misreadings, and the folder map. The agent reads this first to orient.
2. `canon/agent-load-order.md`. It states what to load first for this namespace and why.
   It is navigational, not a knowledge node.
3. `canon/core-doctrine.md`. The compressed first-principles synthesis the agent should
   think from before expanding into the deeper graph. For a Tool Contract namespace this
   is `canon/core-contract.md`. For a stateful namespace, also load
   `canon/current-truth.md` for the live-but-canonical facts.
4. The query-class files. The `INDEX.md` query classes name the specific nodes to load for
   the task at hand. The agent loads only the class that matches.
5. On demand: the long tail (concepts, decisions, playbooks, archive, support) reached by
   edge or by the router, one hop away, only when the task needs it.

Rule LOAD-3: canon is the first content loaded, the `INDEX.md` is the first navigation
read. Both come before the long tail. An agent that dumps a whole namespace into context
instead of following this order is retrieving wrong, not retrieving thoroughly.

Rule LOAD-4: a namespace with `canon_posture: none` (for example `personal-operator`) has
no canon step. The agent loads `INDEX.md`, then the relevant files directly. The `INDEX.md`
of such a namespace says it carries a reduced base.

## Right fragments for the task (locked)

Rule LOAD-5: load the minimal sufficient set, not the maximal available set. The goal is
the few fragments that let the agent reason correctly, in a sensible order, with the rest
one hop away. Filling a context window with loosely relevant material dilutes attention,
raises cost, and buries the load-bearing fact among near-duplicates.

Rule LOAD-6: the query class drives the fragment selection. The `INDEX.md` `Query classes`
section maps a common query type to the specific files that answer it. The agent matches
the task to a query class, loads that class, and stops. It does not pre-load every class.

Rule LOAD-7: deep archives and full provenance are reached on demand. They live in
`archive/` and `support/` and are loaded only when the task needs the raw source or the
migration trail, never as part of the default canon-first load.

Rule LOAD-7A: session transcripts under `sessions/logs/` are also on-demand provenance, not
default context. An agent should load the session record or closeout review first and open
the raw log only for audit, debugging, handoff recovery, or exact-history questions.

## How INDEX.md and canon/agent-load-order drive loading

Rule LOAD-8: the namespace `INDEX.md` is the operative load surface. Its `Load first`
section names canon entry points and the top three to five files for the namespace, each
with a one-line reason. Its `Query classes` section maps query types to files. These two
sections are what an agent reads to decide what to load. The `INDEX.md` schema is governed
by `_system/namespace-index-schema.md`.

Rule LOAD-9: `canon/agent-load-order.md` is the canon-internal load guide. It states the
order to read canon files for the namespace and why. It is navigational and exempt from
node-frontmatter checks. `INDEX.md` points to it; the agent uses both: `INDEX.md` to
orient across the whole namespace, `agent-load-order.md` to sequence the canon read.

Rule LOAD-10: when the load order in `INDEX.md` and `canon/agent-load-order.md` disagree,
`INDEX.md` is the namespace operating brief and wins for cross-namespace orientation;
`agent-load-order.md` wins for the canon-internal sequence. They should not disagree; if
they do, the curator reconciles them in the next health review.

## What validate.sh enforces vs what a curator decides

Deterministic (validate.sh):

- a serious namespace has an `INDEX.md` and a `canon/` directory (required base surface)
- a `canon_posture: full` namespace has `canon/README.md`, `canon/core-doctrine.md`, and
  `canon/agent-load-order.md`
- links named in the load surface resolve (broken relative links and `[[wikilinks]]` are
  errors)

Fuzzy (curator agent, not validate.sh):

- whether the `Load first` list actually contains the highest-signal files
- whether the query classes map to the right fragments for real tasks
- whether the load order in `INDEX.md` and `agent-load-order.md` agree in spirit
- whether canon is small enough relative to the graph to be loaded first cheaply

## Relationship to the public export

Rule LOAD-11: this policy governs internal retrieval by trusted file-reading agents. It
does not govern the public export surface. `INDEX.md` is the rich internal router;
`llms.txt` is a thin public summary generated from canon for external discovery. The two
are different artifacts (contract Part 10) governed by the public LLM index policy.

## Notes

The why lives in [[retrieval-over-raw-memory]]: memory is raw material, retrieval is the
operating layer, the right fragments beat a big context. This file owns the load sequence,
the minimal-sufficient-set rule, and the named consumer. When an MCP or RAG retriever is
introduced, update Rule LOAD-1 to name it and re-derive the load order for that reader.
