# Retrieval Routing Map

Operative contract for selecting namespaces by task class. This file sits one level above
`_system/retrieval-load-order-policy.md`: that policy governs the load order inside a
namespace; this map decides which namespaces to enter at all. The reasoning behind
minimal, query-class-driven retrieval lives in [[retrieval-over-raw-memory]].

## The contract

- Agents consult this map after reading `knowledge/ai-architecture/canon/doctrine-card.md`,
  whenever the task touches a knowledge domain. Tasks that touch no knowledge domain (a
  mechanical file fix, a sprint scaffold, a session closeout) skip the map entirely.
- The map routes; namespaces own their internal load order. After this map names a
  namespace, enter through its `INDEX.md` and sequence the canon read via its
  `canon/agent-load-order.md`, per the LOAD rules in
  `_system/retrieval-load-order-policy.md`.
- Load the primary sequence in order, stop when the task is answerable, and open secondary
  namespaces only when the task genuinely crosses into them. Never pre-load a whole row.
- The scaffolds under `knowledge/_examples/` are pattern references, not retrieval targets
  for domain questions. Load one only when building a new namespace of that profile.
- The registry under `_system/namespaces/` is the source of truth for what each namespace
  is; this map is re-grounded against it when namespaces are added or retired.

## Task classes

The starter ships two registered namespaces, so the map starts small. Extend it with a task
class per namespace as you register more; treat each extension as a contract change.

### Architecture, contract, and canon work

- Primary: `ai-architecture` (the doctrine card you already read, then
  `canon/core-doctrine.md` whole, with `_system/README.md` for the operative contract).
- Secondary: the specific `_system/` rule file the task touches (namespace registration,
  surface contracts, validation), entered directly rather than scanned.
- Skip the deep read when the task implements an already-settled contract (schema edits,
  validator fixes, scaffolding); the doctrine card plus the relevant `_system/` rule suffice.

### Operator goals, priorities, and review cadence

- Primary: `personal-operator` (the operator's goals, priorities, review cadence, and
  operating notes), entered through its `INDEX.md`.
- Secondary: `ai-architecture` only when the operator question turns into a system-design
  question (for example, changing how reviews are routed rather than running one).
- Skip `ai-architecture` for routine planning and review execution; the operator namespace
  is enough.

### Building a new namespace

- Primary: the matching profile scaffold under `knowledge/_examples/` (one of
  `doctrine-example`, `tool-contract-example`, `data-system-example`,
  `design-system-example`, `component-library-example`, `content-strategy-example`,
  `operating-library-example`, `intake-fabric-example`), read as a shape reference.
- Secondary: `knowledge/ai-architecture/concepts/namespace-profiles.md` for the reasoning,
  and `_system/namespace-profiles.md` plus `_system/namespaces/INDEX.md` for the
  registration mechanics.
- The scaffold is copied, never written into; the new namespace registers in
  `_system/namespaces/` and earns its own row in this map.

### ANAC legislation, RBAC, IS, IAC, maintenance, licensing, operations

- Primary: `anac-legislacao`, entered through its `INDEX.md`, then
  `canon/core-doctrine.md`, then `support/indexes/keyword-index.yml`.
- Secondary: only the fragment YAML files the index names.
- Skip `ai-architecture` unless the question is about how the brain stores law, not
  about the law itself.

## When the task fits no class

Match to the nearest class and confirm via `_system/namespaces/INDEX.md` (the catalog with
one-line purposes). If the task plausibly creates a new namespace or changes this map, treat
the map change as a contract change, not an improvisation: route it through the architecture
class above and update `_system/namespaces/INDEX.md`, this map, and
`intake/routing/namespace-routing-map.md` together.
