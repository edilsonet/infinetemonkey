# Retrieval in v3.1: Direct Git Read

This document explains how retrieval works in this repo and how to use it correctly.
Read this before asking why a node is not appearing in search results.

## The principle

**Git is the source of truth, and the working tree is the retrieval surface.**

In v3.1 there is no gbrain installation, no separate index, no MCP server required
for search. Claude Code and Codex read the local git tree directly using their
native primitives: Read, Grep, and Glob. The local clone of this repo plus any
sibling canon or department repos the user has cloned is the entire retrieval
surface.

The full design rationale derives from the upstream deployment's v3 architecture spec;
PROVENANCE.yml at the repo root records the exact source commit this export derives from.

## What gets searched

Agents search node-bearing markdown files in:

1. **This personal repo**: every file under `knowledge/`, `memory/`, `entities/`,
   `outputs/`, `data/`, `projects/`, `intake/`, and `workflows/`.
2. **Sibling canon repos**: if the operator has cloned `../company-canon/`,
   `../department-{name}/`, or other canon repos as siblings, agents include
   their `knowledge/` and `entities/` trees in the search root.

GitHub team permissions determine which canon repos the operator has access to;
cross-repo reads on disk respect that boundary because the operator can only
clone what they can read.

---

## What gets filtered

Agents read each matched file's frontmatter and apply a lifecycle filter:

- **`canon`** nodes always count.
- **`research`** nodes count in this personal repo (your refined work).
- **`candidate`** nodes count when relevant (under-review work).
- **`scratch`** nodes are excluded by default. They are too noisy.

If you want scratch nodes included for a specific query, say so explicitly when
you prompt the agent.

---

## How agents do it

The `[[agent-research-assistant]]` pattern is:

1. `Glob` to enumerate node-bearing markdown files under the relevant subtrees.
2. `Grep -i -l` with the topic and likely synonyms to narrow to files that
   plausibly mention it.
3. `Read` the frontmatter (and body, if confirmed relevant) of the top matches.
4. Filter by `lifecycle_state`.
5. Synthesize.

For path-shaped queries ("all decisions about pricing") `Glob` alone is enough.
For free-text retrieval, `Grep` does the heavy lift.

## When you might add an index later

Direct read scales well to thousands of nodes on a modern machine. If a
deployment ever outgrows it (very high node counts, very large vault sharded
across many repos, or strict latency requirements), an optional retrieval
adapter may be added:

- A vector store keyed on node id.
- A dedicated MCP retrieval server.
- A pre-built `ripgrep`-backed cache.

These are adapters at the edge. They do not change the entity model. The
canonical files in `entities/`, `knowledge/`, `memory/`, etc. remain the source
of truth. The optional adapter is purely a search accelerator.

This is consistent with v3.1 Principle 3 (ports and adapters): runtime is an
adapter at the edge, the canonical model is the core.

### What shipped: the ANAC vector adapter

One deployment has already crossed that threshold. `tools/anac-rag` is a Cloudflare
Worker over a Vectorize index of the ANAC corpus (285 RBAC, IS and IAC documents re-cut
into 7,956 heading-aware windows by `tools/anac_ingest/chunk.py`, embedded with Workers AI
`@cf/baai/bge-m3`). It exposes `POST /query`, `POST /chat` and `GET /health`.

Two properties keep it an accelerator rather than a second source of truth:

- **The filesystem is still the surface.** The Worker does not change the entity model,
  and nothing in the ontology is stored in the index.
- **Every vector resolves to a fragment.** A chunk boundary always lands on a citation
  boundary, so a semantic hit names the same fragment identifier the keyword index names.

The reader is therefore hybrid: precision first (canon, keyword index, named fragments),
recall second (`POST /query`) when the index has no key for the phrasing. See
`_system/retrieval-load-order-policy.md` Rule LOAD-1.

Adding a second such adapter in another deployment is the same exercise: chunk against
citation boundaries, keep the index versioned by namespace, and make the chunk identifier
structural rather than content-derived so a re-run stays idempotent.

## The schema reference

This personal repo contains local validation assets under `_system/`, but the fuller
shared canon schema is still owned by `company-canon/_system/FRONTMATTER-SCHEMA.md`.
To consult that upstream schema once the canon repo is cloned, ask Claude Code:

```
Read the frontmatter schema from the company-canon repo.
```

Claude Code will resolve the file via `Read` on the cloned sibling repo path.
If the canon repo is not cloned alongside, the operator clones it first.
